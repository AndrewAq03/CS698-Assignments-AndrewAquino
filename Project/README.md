### Hello, this is my submission for the Project 
I have uploaded the core python scripts for my project, which involved implementation of ROSA and pydanticAI in our ROS2 maze environment. 

I used Llama3.2 for this project on my respective computer. If you would like to run my code, just download the ROSA repistory first and the 
add my files to the src folder.
