### These are files for Task 2

This is the script I used estimate the pose of an object given its 3D coordinates in the world and its corresponding 2D image coordinates. I used the book's function that wraps solverPnP function as a reference. 

As I mentioned in the video, it was difficult to get postion of an object due image quality of the environment. 

But after moving the robot closer to an object I did get some data, which included the position and orientation of an object.
